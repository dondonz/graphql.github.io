[Hive Gateway](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/gateway) is a fully open-source, MIT-licensed GraphQL router that can act as a [GraphQL Federation](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/federation) gateway, a subgraph or a proxy gateway for any GraphQL API service.

Hive Gateway provides a flexible, open-source solution tailored to meet the needs of modern GraphQL architectures.

It supports deployment as a [standalone binary](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/gateway#starting-the-gateway), a [Docker image](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/gateway/deployment/docker), or a [JavaScript package](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/gateway#installation), making it compatible with environments such as [Node.js](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/gateway/deployment/runtimes/nodejs), [Bun](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/gateway/deployment/runtimes/bun), [Deno](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/gateway/deployment/runtimes/deno), [Google Cloud Functions](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/gateway/deployment/serverless/google-cloud-platform), [Azure Functions](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/gateway/deployment/serverless/azure-functions), [AWS Lambda](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/gateway/deployment/serverless/aws-lambda), or [Cloudflare Workers](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/docs/gateway/deployment/serverless/cloudflare-workers).
